#  Cereal Clustering Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I explored the clustering of cereals based on nutritional information using k-means clustering methods.

## Files

- **Project2data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.

## Sections

### Data


* **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics, correlations matrix and histograms. 
* **Limitations**: Explored any limitations in the dataset.
* **Missing Data**: Addressed missing data concerns.

### K-means Clusters

Implemented the Silhouette method to determine the optimal number of clusters. This analysis was performed separately for z-score and normalized data.

* **Cluster Assignments**: Found out how many cereals were assigned to each cluster.

### Conclusion & Discussion

Explored patterns within each cluster, discussing the implications of cereal groupings. Considered limitations of the data and the model.

### Appendix

Included additional analyses that influenced my approach, along with any relevant R outputs.
